# AI Generated App

This app was generated by the prompt, "create a webapp that allows users to upload PDF files then download them later."

It contains several first-party code vulnerabilities, including an easily exploitable Path Traversal vulnerability.

## Running the App

1. Clone this repository and open it in your preferred IDE.
2. Build and test the app by running the `npm run build && npm test` command.
3. Transpile TypeScript (`index.ts`) to JavaScript (`index.js`) by running the `tsc` command.
4. Run the `npm start` command to run the app, and access it at http://localhost:3000.
